If user data is used to generate the data in this file, it is possible that an attacker could inject a formula when the CSV is imported into a spreadsheet application that runs an attacker script, which could steal data from the importing user or, at worst, install malware on the user's computer. `defusedcsv` is a drop-in replacement with the same API that will attempt to mitigate formula injection attempts. You can use `defusedcsv` instead of `csv` to safely generate CSVs.","metadata":{"category":"security","confidence":"MEDIUM","cwe":["CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File"],"owasp":["A01:2017 - Injection","A03:2021 - Injection"],"references":["https://github.com/raphaelm/defusedcsv","https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/CSV_Injection","https://web.archive.org/web/20220516052229/https://www.contextis.com/us/blog/comma-separated-vulnerabilities"],"technology":["django","python"],"subcategory":["vuln"],"impact":"MEDIUM","likelihood":"MEDIUM"},"severity":"ERROR","fingerprint":"requires login","lines":"requires login","validation_state":"NO_VALIDATOR","engine_kind":"OSS"}}],"errors":[],"paths":{"scanned":["csv-writer-injection.py"]},"skipped_rules":[]}
